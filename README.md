### Notes (Commit - File system update)
- Updated the `urdf` to `xacro`. The code is cleaner now, I guess.
- Updated the launch files accordingly
- Added two cameras and the differential drive plugin in the `virat.gazebo` file.
- Updated the `igvc_ramp.world` according to Ashwin's code to fix the barrel collision bug.
- Some more minor tweaks

### Pending
- `model.sdf` is missing from the virat folder. Convert from xacro.

### Notes (Commit - 21/05)
